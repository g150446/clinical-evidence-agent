  PMID: PMID_39476339
  Title: Once-Weekly Semaglutide in Persons with Obesity and Knee Osteoarthritis.
  Journal: The New England journal of medicine (2024)
  Score: 0.9499771860633338
  PICO Patient: Adults with obesity (BMI ≥30) and a clinical and radiologic diagnosis of moderate knee osteoarthritis with at least moderate pain. Mean age 56 years, mean BMI 40.3, mean WOMAC pain score 70.9. 81.6% women.
  PICO Intervention: Once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide (2.4 mg) in addition to counseling on physical activity and a reduced-calorie diet for 68 weeks.
  PICO Outcome: Percentage change in body weight from baseline to week 68: -13.7% with semaglutide vs. -3.2% with placebo (P<0.001). Change in WOMAC pain score from baseline to week 68: -41.7 points with semaglutide vs. -27.5 points with placebo (P<0.001). Change in SF-36 physical-function score: 12.0 points with semaglutide vs. 6.5 points with placebo (P<0.001).

  PMID: PMID_41090431
  Title: Retatrutide for the treatment of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea and knee osteoarthritis: Rationale and design of the TRIUMPH registrational clinical trials.
  Journal: Diabetes, obesity & metabolism (2026)
  Score: 0.9467549931603424
  PICO Patient: Adults with obesity (BMI ≥27 kg/m² with at least one obesity complication, or BMI ≥35 kg/m²), including those with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), established cardiovascular disease (CVD), moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and/or knee osteoarthritis (OA). Female participation capped at ~70%.
  PICO Intervention: Retatrutide 4, 9, or 12 mg once weekly (QW) subcutaneously, or placebo, for 80 weeks (TRIUMPH-1, -2, -3) or 68 weeks (TRIUMPH-4), following a 16-week dose escalation period. All participants received lifestyle counseling (healthy diet, ≥150 min/week physical activity).
  PICO Outcome: Primary endpoints include percent change in body weight from baseline to Week 80 (TRIUMPH-1, -2, -3), change in Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) from baseline to Week 80 (OSA baskets), and change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale score from baseline to Week 68 (TRIUMPH-4) or Week 80 (OA basket). Type I error controlled at α=0.05, split between overarching weight management and each basket trial.

  Title: Efficacy and Safety of GLP-1 Medicines for Type 2 Diabetes and Obesity.
  Journal: Diabetes care (2024)
  Score: 0.9028617012823631
  PICO Patient: Patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity, and select patient populations with cardiorenal benefits, metabolic liver disease, peripheral artery disease, Parkinson disease, and Alzheimer disease.
  PICO Intervention: Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), tirzepatide (GIP-GLP-1 receptor coagonist), maritide (GIP antagonist, GLP-1 receptor agonist), retatrutide (glucagon and GLP-1 receptor agonist), survodutide (glucagon and GLP-1 receptor agonist).
  PICO Outcome: Cardiorenal benefits, efficacy for new indications (metabolic liver disease, peripheral artery disease, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease), safety (muscle strength, bone density and fractures, exercise capacity, gastrointestinal motility, retained gastric contents and anesthesia, pancreatic and biliary tract disorders, risk of cancer).

  PMID: PMID_40499738
  Title: Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists and Gastrointestinal Adverse Events: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
  Journal: Gastroenterology (2025)
  Score: 0.9017696156693662
  PICO Patient: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, overweight/obesity, or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis/metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.
  PICO Intervention: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs). Specific dosing, duration, and formulation details were evaluated in subgroup analyses but not specified for the overall meta-analysis.
  PICO Outcome: Increased risk of cholelithiasis (Risk Ratio [RR], 1.46; 95% CI, 1.09-1.97; 2 more cases per 1000) and probable increased risk of GERD (RR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.48-3.25; 4 more cases per 1000) compared with placebo.

  Title: Real-world evidence on the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of newer GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies.
  Journal: Diabetes, obesity & metabolism (2025)
  Score: 0.9005868408726982
  PICO Patient: Populations with obesity, including those with type 2 diabetes.
  PICO Intervention: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) including liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide, often at lower doses than evaluated in clinical trials.
  PICO Outcome: Weight reduction, adherence, discontinuation rates, and adverse effects (gastrointestinal disturbances, pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, thyroid disorders, depression, self-harm, eye disease).
