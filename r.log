1. PMID: PMID_41039116 (score: 0.884)
   JSON: data/obesity/pharmacologic/guidelines_and_reviews/papers/PMID_41039116.json
   Title: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatments for obesity in adults.
   PICO:
     Patient: Adults with obesity/overweight, including those with class II (BMI 35–39.9 kg/m²) and class III obesity (BMI ≥40.0 kg/m²). Limited data for BMI <30 kg/m².
     Intervention: Orlistat (360 mg), semaglutide (2.4 mg), liraglutide (3.0 mg), tirzepatide (10–15 mg), naltrexone/bupropion (32/360 mg), phentermine/topiramate (15/92 mg) for ≥48 weeks.
     Outcome: Percentage of total body weight loss (TBWL%) at the end of the study. All OMMs showed significantly greater TBWL% versus placebo (P < 0.0001). Semaglutide and tirzepatide achieved >10% TBWL.

2. PMID: PMID_40789597 (score: 0.880)
   JSON: data/obesity/pharmacologic/guidelines_and_reviews/papers/PMID_40789597.json
   Title: Pharmacotherapy for obesity management in adults: 2025 clinical practice guideline update.
   PICO:
     Patient: Adults (≥18 years) with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or BMI ≥ 27 kg/m² with adiposity-related complications). Specific subpopulations include those with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), knee osteoarthritis (OA), and rare monogenic causes of obesity (Bardet–Biedl syndrome, POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR deficiency).
     Intervention: Pharmacotherapy for obesity management, including Semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly, Tirzepatide (5, 10, 15 mg weekly), Liraglutide 3 mg daily, Naltrexone–bupropion 16 mg/180 mg twice daily, Orlistat 120 mg 3 times daily, and Setmelanotide up to 3 mg daily. Used in conjunction with health behavior changes (medical nutrition therapy, physical activity).
     Outcome: Clinically meaningful weight loss and improvements in obesity-related health complications. Specific outcomes include reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events, improvement in HF symptoms, reduction in progression to type 2 diabetes or achievement of normoglycemia, improved glycemic control, MASH resolution/fibrosis improvement, improved apnea-hypopnea index, and reduced knee pain. Quantitative results for weight change are provided for specific medications.

3. PMID: PMID_39968298 (score: 0.875)
   JSON: data/obesity/pharmacologic/guidelines_and_reviews/papers/PMID_39968298.json
   Title: Comparative efficacy of incretin drugs on glycemic control, body weight, and blood pressure in adults with overweight or obesity and with/without type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
   PICO:
     Patient: Adults with overweight or obesity, with or without type 2 diabetes.
     Intervention: Multi-receptor drugs (Retatrutide, Tirzepatide, Survodutide, Mazdutide, Efinopegdutide, AMG 133) for at least 12 weeks.
     Outcome: Weight reduction (MD: -11.91 kg to -12.78 kg for Retatrutide and Tirzepatide vs placebo), HbA1c reduction (MD: -1.89% for Mazdutide, -1.87% for Tirzepatide in patients with diabetes), FPG reduction (MD: -2.45 mmol/L for Tirzepatide in patients with diabetes), Systolic Blood Pressure reduction (MD: -6.69 mmHg for Tirzepatide), Diastolic Blood Pressure reduction (MD: -3.73 mmHg for Tirzepatide).

   JSON: data/obesity/pharmacologic/novel_agents/papers/PMID_39305981.json
   Title: Seven glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and polyagonists for weight loss in patients with obesity or overweight: an updated systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
   PICO:
     Patient: Patients with obesity or overweight. Patients without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were considered. Patients with high body mass index (BMI) and patients with low BMI were considered. Patients undergoing longer treatment cycles and patients undergoing shorter treatment cycles were considered.
     Intervention: Seven GLP-1 receptor agonists and polyagonists: mazdutide (6 or 4.5 mg), retatrutide (12 or 8 mg), tirzepatide (15 or 10 mg), liraglutide (3.0 mg), semaglutide (2.4 mg), orforglipron (45 or 36 mg), and beinaglutide (0.2 mg). Intervention duration of at least 16 weeks.
     Outcome: Percentage change in body weight from baseline. Retatrutide 12 mg: -22.10% (CI not provided, p-value not provided). Retatrutide 8 mg: -20.70% (CI not provided, p-value not provided). Tirzepatide 15 mg: -16.53% (CI not provided, p-value not provided). Changes in waist circumference, hemoglobin A1c, and fasting plasma glucose level from baseline; adverse events, serious adverse events, adverse event withdrawal, and hypoglycemic events.

5. PMID: PMID_39455729 (score: 0.868)
   JSON: data/obesity/pharmacologic/glp1_receptor_agonists/papers/PMID_39455729.json
   Title: Semaglutide in patients with overweight or obesity and chronic kidney disease without diabetes: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial.
   PICO:
     Patient: Adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥25 ml/min/1.73 m², overweight or obesity, and without diabetes.
     Intervention: Semaglutide (dosage and duration not specified in abstract).
     Outcome: Reduction in albuminuria and risk of kidney disease progression (specific quantitative results, confidence intervals, and p-values not provided in abstract).
